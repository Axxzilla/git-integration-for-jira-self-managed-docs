# What is Git?

<https://bigbrassband.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GIJDC/pages/2047901870>

Git is a source code repository. Developers keep track of their source code using Git.

Git relies heavily on branching and merging. Branching is making a temporary copy of source code for a single purpose like adding a particular feature or fixing a bug. Merging is safely moving the changes from one branch back to another.
