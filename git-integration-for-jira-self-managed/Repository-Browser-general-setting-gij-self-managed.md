For detailed information on this feature, see [Documentation: Repository Browser](/git-integration-for-jira-self-managed/repository-browser-gij-self-managed).

VERSION 3.8.1 Git Integration for Jira adds three new settings in the General settings configuration page:

*   Repository Browser (this page)

*   Source Code Diff Viewing

*   Require user personal access tokens for branch and PR/MR creation


![Repository browser setting in General settings (enabled checked)](https://bigbrassband.atlassian.net/wiki/download/thumbnails/1947140158/gitserver-gencfg-repo-browser.png?version=1&modificationDate=1631802543905&cacheVersion=1&api=v2&width=442&height=89)

The [Repository Browser](/git-integration-for-jira-self-managed/repository-browser-gij-self-managed) allows users to view git repositories of configured projects.

The default setting is `Enabled` for new and existing Git Integration for Jira app installations. This setting is retained on restore/upgrade of the app.

If this setting is disabled (_unchecked_) in General settings, the **Git** dashboard menu will not be available for any user except administrators (to have access to the Manage repositories shortcut). When set to `Disabled`, it also overrides repository and integration settings, thereby, setting them also to `Disabled`.
