INTRODUCED IN VERSION 2.11.2

Self-signed certificates are common in HTTPS Git repositories that are hosted privately. Even for an administrator, it's not easy to set the HTTP `sslVerify` to connect to this repository.

As of **v2.11.2+** of the Git Integration app, the Jira administrator now has the option to disable `sslVerify` for specific repositories while inside Jira.

This feature is available in [Connect to Git Repository](/wiki/spaces/GIJDC/pages/1930397090/Using+the+Connect+Repository+wizard) wizard and [Add new integration wizard](/wiki/spaces/GIJDC/pages/1930397044/Using+the+Add+new+integration+wizard) for GitHub and GitLab.
