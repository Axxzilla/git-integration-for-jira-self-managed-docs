**Note**
Jira Cloud does not have the Support Zip feature.


_(The old video is removed. Updated Video guide coming soon)_

Jira can produce a Support Zip file for diagnosing issues. This will give our support team a better view of the issue.

You can create this file by accessing the Atlassian Support Tools in your Jira:

1.  On your Jira Server dashboard, go to **Jira Administration**.

2.  Click **System**.

3.  On the left sidebar, click **Troubleshooting and support tools**.

4.  Click the **Create support zip** tab.

5.  For **Customize zip**, leave all check marked options (recommended) or check/uncheck required information to generate.
    RECOMMENDED For Jira Data Center instances, you may include **Thread dumps** for performance analysis.

6.  Click **Create zip** to start generating support data.


Locate the generated Support Zip file and send it to [support@bigbrassband.com](mailto:support@bigbrassband.com).
