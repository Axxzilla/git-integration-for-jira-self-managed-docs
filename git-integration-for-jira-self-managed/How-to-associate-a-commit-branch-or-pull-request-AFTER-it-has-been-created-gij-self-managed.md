**For commits:** – these can be associated either via [manual association feature](/git-integration-for-jira-self-managed/manually-link-git-commits-to-jira-issues-gij-self-managed) of the Git Integration for Jira app or via Git Notes.
**For branches** – these cannot be re-associated after creation because git does not allow branches to be renamed.
**For pull/merge requests** – just editing the PR/MR titles to include the Jira issue and then perform reindex will associate the PR/MR to the specified Jira issue. Also, editing their descriptions will associate the PR/MR to the specified Jira issue as well.
