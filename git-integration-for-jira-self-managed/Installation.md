Install our product via the Atlassian Marketplace, Jira Plugin Manager or with manual installation (using the Upload method).

## Getting started

If the Git server and Jira server are installed on the same server, only the path to the Git repository is needed. The URL and the access credentials to the Git server will only be needed if it is located on another server.

You must have the **Jira System Administrators** _global permission_ to install apps.

If you have the previous version of the Git Integration app and will upgrade to **v4.0+**, all existing repositories in the app configuration will have the **Repository Browser** feature **turned off** by default. For more information about this feature and how to enable it, see [Repository Browser](/git-integration-for-jira-self-managed/Repository-Browser).

_Right click_ [_**here**_](https://bigbrassband.wistia.com/medias/lr0jp6ntfd) _to open this video in a new browser tab for more viewing options._
