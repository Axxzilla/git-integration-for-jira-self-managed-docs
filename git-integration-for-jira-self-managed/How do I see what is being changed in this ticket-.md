Open an issue in your browser and click on the **Git Commits** tab.

When a developer submits a change to Git, they can type a brief message that summarizes the changes.  These messages show up under the Committer/Author's name.

The files that were changed by the developer appear as clickable links. Click on the file links to view the actual source code that was changed.
