As of **v2.6.5+** of the Git Integration for Jira app, the Jira user card is available on the following screens:

*   Git Commits tab _(Commit author name)_
    
*   Repositories list _(Last updated by)_
    
*   Repository Browser _(under Latest commit column)_
    
*   Code diff dialog _(Commit info)_

Hover the mouse pointer on the name of the user.  A small information box containing information such as email, zone & time and avatar for that user will appear.

Click **Activity** to view the latest activities performed by that user.

Click **More▾** to open more options such as:

*   view this user’s profile,
    
*   view unresolved issues currently assigned to this user, or
    
*   go to the administration section for this user.
    

The [Git user identity](/wiki/spaces/GIJDC/pages/1930398801/Git+user+identity) should be configured for the specific user. Otherwise, the user card information will not be displayed for that user.
