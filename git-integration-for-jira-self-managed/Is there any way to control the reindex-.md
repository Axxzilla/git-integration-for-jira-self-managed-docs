In terms of kicking off the indexing based on an event, you have two options:

*   [Reindex API](/wiki/spaces/GIJDC/pages/380699270/Reindex+API)
    
*   [Webhooks overview](/wiki/spaces/GIJDC/pages/94142715/Webhooks)
    
*   [Integration webhooks documentation](/wiki/spaces/GIJDC/pages/1930399378/Integration+webhooks)
    

What other users have done is set a high interval and then configure one of those options.
