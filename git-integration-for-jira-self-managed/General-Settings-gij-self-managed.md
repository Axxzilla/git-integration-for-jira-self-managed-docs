After making changes to the configuration settings, click **Save** to apply the changes.

Every git installation has global config file and .git/config file in every git repository. All settings at the global level can be overridden at the repository level. Therefore, different email addresses can be set for every git repository.

For more details on git configuration, see [**Customizing Git: Git Configuration**](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Customizing-Git-Git-Configuration).
