In terms of kicking off the indexing based on an event, you have two options:

*   [Reindex API](/git-integration-for-jira-self-managed/reindex-api-gij-self-managed)

*   [Webhooks overview](/git-integration-for-jira-self-managed/webhooks-gij-self-managed)

*   [Integration webhooks documentation](/git-integration-for-jira-self-managed/integration-webhooks-gij-self-managed)


What other users have done is set a high interval and then configure one of those options.
